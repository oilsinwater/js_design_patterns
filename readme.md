# Exploring Resusable Vanilla Javascript  and Typescript code with Design Patterns

Design patterns can be and should be used to write better maintainable JavaScript. The underlying concepts of design patterns were around in the software engineering industry since the very start, but they were not so formalized. Design Patterns: Elements Of Reusable Object-Oriented Software written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides — the famous Gang of Four (GoF) was instrumental in pushing the formalized concept of design patterns in software engineering. Now, design patterns are an essential part of software development and have been so for a long time.

Common Design patterns
